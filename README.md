## Dependencies

You can install all dependencies by running one of the following commands

You need a [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to use the environment setting.

```python
# Use TensorFlow without GPU
conda env create -f environments.yml 
dependencies:
    - python==3.5.2
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - jupyter
    - opencv3
    - pillow
    - scikit-learn
    - scikit-image
    - scipy
    - h5py
    - eventlet
    - flask-socketio
    - seaborn
    - pandas
    - imageio
    - pip:
        - moviepy
        - tensorflow==1.1
        - keras==1.2


# Use TensorFlow with GPU
conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml
dependencies:
    - python==3.5.2
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - jupyter
    - opencv3
    - pillow
    - scikit-learn
    - scikit-image
    - scipy
    - h5py
    - eventlet
    - flask-socketio
    - seaborn
    - pandas
    - imageio
    - pip:
        - moviepy
        - tensorflow-gpu==1.1
        - keras==1.2

```

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt*.yml files) using pip.


## Usage


### Run the pretrained model

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python drive.py model.h5
```

### To train the model

You'll need the data folder which contains the training images.

```python
python model.py
```

This will generate a file `model-<epoch>.h5` whenever the performance in the epoch is better than the previous best.  For example, the first epoch will generate a file called `model-000.h5`.
